# nosql-challenge
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.
I created the following code to mongoimport the dataset for this nosql challenge: mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json
I created the code in this repro using a combination of class activities, one on one tutorials, stack overflow and youtube tutorial videos. 
I committed to this repo a couple of times after a comment from one of the graders, I hope I have satisfied the requirement this time.
